            Hello @${issue.user.login} 👋
            Unfortunately your issue does not follow the format outlined in the template, and has therefore been auto-closed.
            To ensure that all relevant info is included, please either update or recreate your issue, and complete the sub-headings provided.
            Thank you :)
