# Theming

By default Dashy comes with 25+ built-in themes, which can be applied from the dropwodwn menu in the UI.

You can also add your own themes, apply custom styles, and modify colors.

You can customize Dashy by writing your own CSS, which can be loaded either as an external stylesheet, set directly through the UI, or specified in the config file. Most styling options can be set through CSS variables, which are outlined below.

The following content requires that you have a basic understanding of CSS. If you're just beginning, you may find [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) helpful.


### How Theme-Switching Works

The theme switching is done by simply changing the `data-theme` attribute on the root DOM element, which can then be targeted by CSS. First off, in order for the theme to show up in the theme switcher, it needs to be added to the config file, under `appConfig.cssThemes`, either as a string, or an array of strings for multiple themes. For example:

```yaml
appConfig:
  cssThemes: ['tiger', 'another-theme']
```

You can now create a block to target you're theme with `html[data-theme='my-theme']{}` and set some styles. The easiest method is by setting CSS variables, but you can also directly override elements by their selector. As an example, see the [built-in CSS themes](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/styles/color-themes.scss).

```css
html[data-theme='tiger'] {
  --primary: #f58233;
  --background: #0b1021;
}
```

Finally, from the UI use the theme dropdown menu to select your new theme, and your styles will be applied.

You can also set `appConfig.theme` to pre-select a default theme, which will be applied immediately after deployment.

### Modifying Theme Colors

Themes can be modified either through the UI, using the color picker menu (to the right of the theme dropdown), or directly in the config file, under `appConfig.customColors`. Here you can specify the value for any of the [available CSS variables](#css-variables).

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://i.ibb.co/cLDXj1R/dashy-theme-configurator.gif">
    <img alt="Example Themes" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/dashy/master/docs/assets/theme-config-demo.gif" width="400" />
  </a>
</p>

By default, any color modifications made to the current theme through the UI will only be applied locally. If you need these settings to be set globally, then click the 'Export' button, to get the color codes and variable names, which can then be backed up, or saved in your config file.

Custom colors are saved relative the the base theme selected. So if you switch themes after setting custom colors, then you're settings will no longer be applied. You're changes are not lost though, and switching back to the original theme will see your styles reapplied.

If these values are specified in your `conf.yml` file, then it will look something like the below example. Note that in YAML, values or keys which contain special characters, must be wrapped in quotes.

```yaml
appConfig:
  customColors:
    oblivion:
      primary: '#75efff'
      background: '#2a3647'
    dracula:
      primary: '#8be9fd'
```

### Adding your own Theme

User-defined styles and custom themes should be defined in `./src/styles/user-defined-themes.scss`. If you're using Docker, you can pass your own stylesheet in using the `--volume` flag. E.g. `v ./my-themes.scss:/app/src/styles/user-defined-themes.scss`. Don't forget to pass your theme name into `appConfig.cssThemes` so that it shows up on the theme-switcher dropdown.

### Setting Custom CSS in the UI

Custom CSS can be developed, tested and applied directly through the UI. Although you will need to make note of your changes to apply them across instances.

This can be done from the Config menu (spanner icon in the top-right), under the Custom Styles tab. This is then associated with `appConfig.customCss` in local storage. Styles can also be directly applied to this attribute in the config file, but this may get messy very quickly if you have a lot of CSS.

### Page-Specific Styles

If you've got multiple pages within your dashboard, you can choose to target certain styles to specific pages. The top-most element within `<body>` will have a class name specific to the current sub-page. This is usually the page's name, all lowercase, with dashes instead of spaces, but you can easily check this yourself within the dev tools.

For example, if the pages name was "CFT Toolbox", and you wanted to target `.item`s, you would do:

```css
.cft-toolbox .item { border: 4px solid yellow; }
```

### Loading External Stylesheets

The URI of a stylesheet, either local or hosted on a remote CDN can be passed into the config file. The attribute `appConfig.externalStyleSheet` accepts either a string, or an array of strings. You can also pass custom font stylesheets here, they must be in a CSS format (for example, `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cutive+Mono`).
This is handled in [`ThemeHelper.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/utils/ThemeHelper.js).

For example:

```yaml
appConfig:
  externalStyleSheet: 'https://example.com/my-stylesheet.css'
```

```yaml
appConfig:
  externalStyleSheet: ['/themes/my-theme-1.css', '/themes/my-theme-2.css']
```
### Hard-Coding Section or Item Colors

Some UI components have a color option, that can be set in the config file, to force the color of a given item or section no matter what theme is selected. These colors should be expressed as hex codes (e.g. `#fff`) or HTML colors (e.g. `red`). The following attributes are supported:
- `section.color` - Custom color for a given section
- `item.color` - Font and icon color for a given item
- `item.backgroundColor` - Background color for a given icon

### Typography

Essential fonts bundled within the app are located within `./src/assets/fonts/`. All optional fonts that are used by themes are stored in `./public/fonts/`, if you want to add your own font, this is where you should put it. As with assets, if you're using Docker then using a volume to link a directory on your host system with this path within the container will make management much easier.

Fonts which are not being used by the current theme are **not** fetched on page load. They are instead only loaded into the application if and when they are required. So having multiple themes with various typefaces shouldn't have any negative impact on performance.

### CSS Variables

All colors as well as other variable values (such as borders, border-radius, shadows) are specified as CSS variables. This makes theming the application easy, as you only need to change a given color or value in one place. You can find all variables in [`color-palette.scss`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/styles/color-palette.scss) and the themes which make use of these color variables are specified in [`color-themes.scss`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/src/styles/color-themes.scss)

CSS variables are simple to use. You define them like: `--background: #fff;` and use them like: `body { background-color: var(--background); }`. For more information, see this guide on using [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

You can determine the variable used by any given element, and visualize changes using the browser developer tools (Usually opened with `F12`, or Options --> More --> Developer Tools). Under the elements tab, click the Element Selector icon (usually top-left corner), you will then be able to select any DOM element on the page by hovering and clicking it. In the CSS panel you will see all styles assigned to that given element, including CSS variables. Click a variable to see it's parent value, and for color attributes, click the color square to modify the color. For more information, see this [getting started guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools), and these articles on [selecting elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Select_an_element) and [inspecting and modifying colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Inspect_and_select_colors).
