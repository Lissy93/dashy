# Configuring

All app configuration is specified in [`/public/conf.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/public/conf.yml) which is in [YAML Format](https://yaml.org/) format. If you're using Docker, this file can be passed in as a volume. Changes can either be made directly to this file, or done [through the UI](#editing-config-through-the-ui). From the UI you can also export, backup, reset, validate and download your configuration file.

## There are three ways to edit the config

- **Directly in the YAML file** _(5/5 reliability, 3/5 usability)_
  - Write changes directly to the conf.yml file, optionally using one of the templates provided. This can be done in your favorite editor and uploading to your server, or directly editing the file via SSH, but the easiest method would be to use [Code Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server)
- **UI JSON Editor** _(4/5 reliability, 4/5 usability)_
  - From the UI, under the config menu there is a JSON editor, with built-in validation, documentation and advanced options
- **UI Visual Editor** _(3/5 reliability, 5/5 usability)_
  - From the UI, enter the Interactive Edit Mode, then click any part of the page to edit. Changes are previewed live, and then saved to disk
- **REST API** _(Coming soon)_
  - Programmatically edit config either through the command line, using a script or a third-party application

## Tips

- You may find it helpful to look at some sample config files to get you started, a collection of which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10)
- You can check that your config file fits the schema, by running `yarn validate-config`
- After modifying your config, the app needs to be recompiled, by running `yarn build`  - this happens automatically if you're using Docker
- It is recommended to keep a backup of your config file. You can download it under Config menu, or use the [Cloud Backup](./docs/backup-restore.md) feature.
- You can make use of YAML features, like anchors, comments, multi-line strings, etc to reuse attributes and keep your config file readable
- Once you have finished configuring your dashboard, you can choose to [disable UI config](#preventing-changes) if you wish
- All fields are optional, unless otherwise stated.

The following file provides a reference of all supported configuration options.

This must be a language that the app has already been [translated](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/tree/master/src/assets/locales) into. If your language is unavailable, Dashy will fallback to English. By default Dashy will attempt to auto-detect your language, although this may not work on some privacy browsers.
**`startingView`** | `enum` | _Optional_ | Which page to load by default, and on the base page or domain root. You can still switch to different views from within the UI. Can be either `default`, `minimal` or `workspace`. Defaults to `default`

**`iconSize`** | `enum` | _Optional_ | The size of link items / icons. Can be either `small`, `medium,` or `large`. Defaults to `medium`. This can also be set directly from the UI.
**`colCount`** | `number` | _Optional_ | The number of columns of sections displayed on the homepage, using the default view. Should be in integer between `1` and `8`. Note that by default this is applied responsively, based on current screen size, and specifying a value here will override this behavior, which may not be desirable.

Determines the URL format for sub-pages, hash mode will look like `/#/home` whereas with history mode available you have nice clean URLs, like `/home`. For more info, see the [Vue docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html#example-server-configurations). If you're hosting Dashy with a custom BASE_URL, you will find that a bit of extra server config is necessary to get history mode working, so here you may want to instead use `hash` mode.Defaults to `history`.
**`enableMultiTasking`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If set to true, will keep apps open in the background when in the workspace view. Useful for quickly switching between multiple sites, and preserving their state, but comes at the cost of performance.

**`enableErrorReporting`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Enable reporting of unexpected errors and crashes. This is off by default, and **no data will ever be captured unless you explicitly enable it**. Turning on error reporting helps previously unknown bugs get discovered and fixed. Dashy uses [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) for error reporting. Defaults to `false`.
**`sentryDsn`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If you need to monitor errors in your instance, then you can use Sentry to collect and process bug reports. Sentry can be self-hosted, or used as SaaS, once your instance is setup, then all you need to do is pass in the DSN here, and enable error reporting. You can learn more on the [Sentry DSN Docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/). Note that this will only ever be used if `enableErrorReporting` is explicitly enabled.
**`disableSmartSort`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | For the most-used and last-used app sort functions to work, a basic open-count is stored in local storage. If you do not want this to happen, then disable smart sort here, but you wil no longer be able to use these sort options. Defaults to `false`.
**`disableUpdateChecks`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If set to true, Dashy will not check for updates. Defaults to `false`.
**`enableServiceWorker`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | Service workers cache web applications to improve load times and offer basic offline functionality, and are enabled by default in Dashy. The service worker can sometimes cause older content to be cached, requiring the app to be hard-refreshed. If you do not want SW functionality, or are having issues with caching, set this property to `false` to disable all service workers.
**`disableContextMenu`** | `boolean` | _Optional_ | If set to `true`, the custom right-click context menu will be disabled. Defaults to `false`.

## Notes

### Editing Config through the UI

Config can be modified directly through the UI, and then written to disk, or applied locally. This can be done wither with the raw config editor (introduced in V 0.6.5 / [#3](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/pull/3)), or the interactive editor (introduced in V 1.8.9 / [#298](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/pull/298)).

### About YAML

If you're new to YAML, it's pretty straight-forward. The format is exactly the same as that of JSON, but instead of using curly braces, structure is denoted using whitespace. This [quick guide](https://linuxhandbook.com/yaml-basics/) should get you up to speed in a few minutes, for more advanced topics take a look at this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

### Config Saving Methods

When updating the config through the JSON editor in the UI, you have two save options: **Local** or **Write to Disk**.

- Changes saved locally will only be applied to the current user through the browser, and will not apply to other instances - you either need to use the cloud sync feature, or manually update the conf.yml file.
- On the other-hand, if you choose to write changes to disk, then your main `conf.yml` file will be updated, and changes will be applied to all users, and visible across all devices. For this functionality to work, you must be running Dashy with using the Docker container, or the Node server.  A backup of your current configuration will also be saved in the same directory.

### Preventing Changes

If you have authentication set up, then any user who is not an admin (with `type: admin`) will not be able to write changes to disk.

You can also prevent changes from any user being written to disk, using `preventWriteToDisk`. Or prevent any changes from being saved locally in browser storage, using `preventLocalSave`.

To disable all UI config features, set `disableConfiguration`. Alternatively you can disable UI config features for all non Admin users by setting `disableConfigurationForNonAdmin` to true.
